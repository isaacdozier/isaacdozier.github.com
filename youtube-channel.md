## My Youtube Channel

My youtube channel is mostly a collection of 'How to', home improvement, auto repair, and other related videos. I have many videos where I work on my 88 Toyota Pickup. I try to upload as many 22R videos as I can. When I had to replace the head gasket on my truck, I found it difficult to find good videos of 22R engines on YouTube. Figured I'd make some.

Popular Playlists from my Channel:
