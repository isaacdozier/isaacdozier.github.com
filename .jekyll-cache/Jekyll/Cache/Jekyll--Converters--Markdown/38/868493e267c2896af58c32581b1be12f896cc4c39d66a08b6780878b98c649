<h3 id="the-open-source-website-project">The Open Source Website Project</h3>

<p>This is a website I created for a github community of self taught programmers.</p>

<p>This project is open source and anyone can contribute in <a href="https://github.com/selftaughtprogrammers/selftaughtprogrammers.github.io">Github</a>.</p>

<p>This project was created with new programmers in mind. We hope that this project will enable new coders to contribute to an existing open source project without fear. You wonâ€™t mess anything up, I promise.</p>

<p>Give it a try!</p>
