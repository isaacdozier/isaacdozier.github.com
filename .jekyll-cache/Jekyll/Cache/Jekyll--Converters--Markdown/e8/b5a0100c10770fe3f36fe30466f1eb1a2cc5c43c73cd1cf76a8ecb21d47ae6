<h3 id="basic-html-page">Basic HTML Page</h3>

<p>This is a basic HTML page using HTML CSS and Bootstrap. 
A FreeCodeCamp ‘tribute page’ project; 
mine is dedicated to Michael Faraday, a pioneer of electrical studies.</p>

<p>This project was a great way for me to refresh on current HTML and Bootstrap standards.</p>
