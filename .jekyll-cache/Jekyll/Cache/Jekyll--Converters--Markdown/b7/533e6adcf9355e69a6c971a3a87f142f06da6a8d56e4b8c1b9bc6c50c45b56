<h2 id="my-youtube-channel">My Youtube Channel</h2>

<p>My youtube channel is mostly a collection of â€˜How toâ€™, home improvement, auto repair, and other related videos. I have many videos where I work on my 88 Toyota Pickup. I try to upload as many 22R videos as I can. When I had to replace the head gasket on my truck, I found it difficult to find good videos of 22R engines on YouTube. Figured Iâ€™d make some.</p>
