<p>Closed Captions (CC) are meant to help the hearing impaired gain access to audio information they would otherwise not be able to take advantage of.</p>

<p>Converting sounds 👂 to sight 👁 can make a big difference in the world.</p>

<p>According to NIDCD, “About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with a detectable level of hearing loss in one or both ears.”.</p>

<p>According to the W.H.O (World Health Orginization), “There are 466 million people in the world with disabling hearing loss.”.</p>
