Thanks [@ric_mclaughlin](https://twitter.com/ric_mclaughlin) for teaching our class to use tools like Jekyll, Github, Gulp and more. 
The ability to link a developement enviroment to a github repo is invaluable to any type of developer or software engineer. 
Using that same Github repo as a static page hosting service adds even more value to those who are still learning to code.

### Follow Up:

Ric's tech class was a great experience. 
I highly suggest anyone in the Seattle area who is 
interested in learning about Github, Ruby, Node.js or any tool for that matter, 
try to attend one of these FREE classes.
