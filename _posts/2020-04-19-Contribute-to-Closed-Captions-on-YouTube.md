### Contribute to an Youtube Closed Captioning / CC

Closed Captions (CC) are meant to help the hearing impaired gain access to audio information they would otherwise not be able to take advantage of.

Converting sounds üëÇ to sight üëÅ can make a big difference in the world.

According to NIDCD, "About 2 to 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with a detectable level of hearing loss in one or both ears.".

According to the W.H.O (World Health Orginization), "There are 466 million people in the world with disabling hearing loss.".
