### The Open Source Website Project

This is a website I created for a github community of self taught programmers.

This project is open source and anyone can contribute in [Github](https://github.com/selftaughtprogrammers/selftaughtprogrammers.github.io).

This project was created with new programmers in mind. We hope that this project will enable new coders to contribute to an existing open source project without fear. You won't mess anything up, I promise.

Give it a try!
